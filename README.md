# Simple_Banking_System

Technology: SQL with Python, sqlite

Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. 
Today, most people have credit cards, which saves us time and energy and protects us from unnecessary stress. 
Cards make our lives easier in so many ways  to carry a wallet full of cash to providing consumer protection.
In this project, I have developed a simple banking system with a database. Here you can use your card to check balance or make transactions.
